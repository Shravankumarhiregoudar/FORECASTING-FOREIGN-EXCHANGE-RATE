# FORECASTING-FOREIGN-EXCHANGE-RATE

In our project we have explored foreign exchange data. We analyse monthly returns for the four major currencies, Brazilian Real (BRL.USD), Russian Ruble (RUB.USD), Indian rupees (INR.USD) and Chinese Yuan (YUAN.USD )

We consider the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. Unlike stock prices, foreign exchange rates are strongly influenced by policies of countries or currency unions. 

Foreign exchange markets are considered to be the most liquid market of all. Given the large amount of research dedicated to equity markets, findings about foreign exchange markets can be used to crosscheck findings about stock prices.

# OBJECTIVE

The ability to predict enhance the accuracy of financial projections and help businesses budget with greater confidence. 

Using a currency exchange rate forecast can help brokers and businesses make informed decisions to help minimize risks and maximize returns. 

The forecast also helps the government to take decisions on their countryâ€™s GDP and other factors.
